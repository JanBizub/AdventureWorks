The scenario is like this:
- EDIGateway.API/EdiReceiverController.cs receives an EDI message
- It somehow notifies the EDIMonitor.API/EdiMonitor controller that mesages were received
- That controller is used in the edi-monitor-client react app which is notified in real time and displays some basic info about received messages in simple list

Please do it.
